            <li>(e) An “<strong>Eligible Vehicle</strong>” is a personal passenger (non-commercial) vehicle:
              <ul>
                <li>(1) of which a Driver Member has lawful possession;</li>
                <li>(2) for which a Driver Member has all required permissions to use in connection with the Services and any Carpool Trip;</li>

                <li>(11)  which is up to date with all vehicle maintenance and upkeep recommended by the vehicle’s owners’ manual, maintenance guide, or similar document;</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>(f) “<strong>Origin</strong>” means the starting location of a Carpool Trip as indicated by the Platform; and</li>
            <li>(g) “<strong>Destination</strong>” means the ending destination of a Carpool Trip as indicated by the Platform.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><u>4.2  Searching for a Carpool Trip. </u></strong> If you are a Rider Member, you can use the Platform in order to locate and bid on an Available Seat for a Carpool Trip. In order to do so, you will use the Platform to Supply certain information about the type of Carpool Trip for which you are searching, including the Origin, Destination, Departure Time, and Arrival Time with respect to such Carpool Trip. After you Supply such information, the Platform will take such information and “match” you with Carpool Trips with Available Seats on which you may be interested in bidding (each, a “<strong>Carpool Option,</strong>” and collectively, the “<strong>Carpool Options</strong>”).</li>
        <li><strong><u>4.3  Matching Results. </u></strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><u>(a)  Your Receipt of Content Supplied by Carpool Options. </u></strong> If Wyth identifies a Carpool Option for you, Wyth will provide you with certain Content Supplied by the Driver Member offering such Carpool Option. This Content will include such Driver Member’s Profile.</li>
            <li><strong><u>(b)   Sharing of Content from Your Profile. </u></strong> You understand that not only will you potentially receive Content Supplied by Driver Members offering Carpool Options (including their Profile Content), but that Content you Supply to Wyth (including the Content you Supply for your Profile) may also be made available to Driver Members offering Carpool Options. Additionally, you may be contacted directly by Driver Members via the messaging and chat features in the App. With respect to Content you Supply to Wyth, you grant Wyth, its affiliates, licensees, successors, and representatives an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, worldwide right and license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such Content and the irrevocable right to transfer or sublicense the Content with the transferor or sublicensee, respectively, having the right to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, publicly display, and prepare derivative works of, such Content (in whole or in part and including any such derivative works) and to incorporate such Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed. This Section 4.3(b) will survive termination of this Agreement.</li>
            <li><strong><u>(c)  No Obligation or Guarantee Regarding the Quality or “Fit” of Carpool Options. </u></strong> Although Wyth aims to provide you with Carpool Options that may be a good fit in terms of the criteria of a Carpool Trip for which you are searching, Wyth does not have an obligation to provide you with the “best” Carpool Options. In addition, Wyth does not guarantee that any Carpool Option will be a good fit for your needs. This Section 4.3(c) will survive termination of this Agreement.  </li>
            <li><strong><u>(d)  No Obligation or Guarantee Regarding Number of Carpool Options. </u></strong> While it is Wyth’s desire that you find a Carpool Option that is acceptable to you via use of the Services, Wyth does not guarantee that you will find a Carpool Option through your use of the Services, and Wyth does not guarantee that it will present you with any, or any specific number of, Carpool Options. Wyth also disclaims any obligation to continually or periodically update or rematch the Content you Supply in connection with searching for a Carpool Trip with any newly-available Carpool Options.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><u>4.4  Evaluating Carpool Options. </u></strong> You should consider many factors when evaluating whether to bid on an Available Seat on a Carpool Trip including whether the Origin, Destination, Departure Time, and Arrival Time of such Carpool Trip are acceptable to you and whether you are comfortable with Content Supplied by the Driver Member who is offering such Carpool Trip. BY OFFERING A BID, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WYTH DOES NOT CONDUCT BACKGROUND CHECKS, CREDIT CHECKS OR SIMILAR “SCREENING” ON RIDER MEMBERS OR DRIVER MEMBERS AND THAT WYTH DOES NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO FACT-CHECK RIDER MEMBER OR DRIVER MEMBER CONTENT, OR VERIFY THAT THE PICTURE UPLOADED TO THE RIDER MEMBER OR DRIVER MEMBER PROFILE MATCHES THE DRIVER MEMBER OR RIDER MEMBER. IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE AND SAFE TAKING A CARPOOL TRIP, AND YOUR SAFETY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND ANY CARPOOL TRIP IS SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><u>5. Bidding on a Carpool Trip.</u></strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><u>5.1  Suggested Reimbursement Amounts. </u></strong> If you find a Carpool Trip with an Available Seat for which you would like to bid, you will use the Platform to select the amount of reimbursement (the “Bid”) per mile you are willing to offer for such Carpool Trip. The Platform will suggest a Bid for each Carpool Trip (each a, “<strong>Suggested Bid Amount</strong>”) based on the distance of the trip and other factors, including the Bids that the Driver Member offering such Carpool Trip has accepted in the past. You are not required to offer a Suggested Bid Amount as a Bid, and your Bid will not necessarily be accepted for a particular Carpool Trip if you offer a Suggested Bid Amount. If the Driver Member considers your Bid to be too low, the Driver Member may make a counter-offer.</li>
        <li><strong><u>5.2  Notification of Accepted Bid. </u></strong> If you submit a Bid for a Carpool Trip and it is accepted by the Driver Member offering such Carpool Trip, or if you accept a counter-offer presented by a Driver Member, you will be notified of such acceptance by the Platform, and such Carpool Trip will be considered a “<strong>Confirmed Trip.</strong>” The Bid you offered for such Confirmed Trip at the time of acceptance by the Driver Member for such Carpool Trip will be referred to as a “<strong>Confirmed Bid.</strong>” For the avoidance of doubt, a “<strong>Confirmed Trip</strong>” is a Carpool Trip that has at least one confirmed Rider Member passenger (due to such Rider Member having a Confirmed Bid) and that is scheduled to operate.</li>
        <li><strong><u>5.3  Significance of a Confirmed Bid. </u></strong> If you have a Confirmed Bid on a Confirmed Trip, you are confirmed as a passenger on such Confirmed Trip and the number of Available Seats for such Confirmed Trip will decrease by one. If you do NOT have a Confirmed Bid on a Confirmed Trip, you will NOT be a passenger on such trip. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><u>6. Confirmed Trips. </u></strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><u>6.1  Prompt Arrival. </u></strong> You are responsible for arriving at the Origin of a Confirmed Trip on time prior to the Departure Time. </li>
        <li><strong><u>6.2  Vehicle Rules. </u></strong> You will comply with any reasonable and lawful trip rules the Driver Member offering a Confirmed Trip verbalizes to you including rules such as keeping voices at a reasonable volume inside the Eligible Vehicle or no eating or drinking (except for water) in the Eligible Vehicle. IN ADDITION, YOU WILL WEAR YOUR SEATBELT AT ALL TIMES WHILE IN A VEHICLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES.</li>
        <li><strong><u>6.3  During the Course of a Confirmed Trip. </u></strong> Wyth does not monitor or oversee Confirmed Trips. It is up to you to make sure that if at any time you feel unsafe on a Confirmed Trip, including if you observe a Driver Member violating the Law, that you contact the proper authorities to help. </li>
        <li><strong><u>6.4  Reporting Violations of the “Wyth Membership Agreement -- Driver Member”. </u></strong> If you observe a Driver Member violating the “Wyth Membership Agreement -- Driver Member” [Link] (the “<strong>Driver Membership Agreement</strong>”), (for example, by texting while driving), and if you feel it is safe to do so, you should ask such Driver Member to cease such violation and you should report such violation to local authorities (if appropriate) and to Wyth, so Wyth can investigate such violation if (in Wyth’s sole discretion) it is appropriate to do so.</li>
        <li><strong><u>6.5  Cancellation. You can cancel a Confirmed Trip at any time prior to pick-up. </u></strong> However, if you cancel the trip within 24 hours before the trip begins, you will be charged a cancellation fee. Because your Rider Profile includes the number of trips cancelled, your ratings may suffer as a result. If you choose to cancel the Confirmed Trip, the Driver Member will be notified via email or SMS. Similarly, if the Driver Member cancels the Confirmed Trip, you will be notified via email or SMS.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><u>7. Prohibited Uses of the Services; Wyth’s Right to Investigate and Remove Prohibited Content; Items the Services Do Not Provide. </u></strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><u>7.1  Prohibited Uses. </u></strong>You agree and represent that you are accessing the Services with the intent of locating carpooling opportunities and that you will not use (or attempt to use) the Services (either by your action or your omission), or take (or attempt to take) any action in connection with the Services, as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>(a) for the purpose of obtaining personal information of a Rider Member or Driver Member;</li>

            <li>(c) to find a Carpool Option using the Services and then completing payment for such trip or arranging such trip outside of the context of the Services and the Platform; </li>
            <li>(d) in violation of, or to violate, any law, regulation, ordinance, rule, or similar authority (each, a “<strong>Law</strong>”); </li>
            <li>(e) to commit fraud; </li>
            <li>(f) in connection with any for-hire, for-profit, or commercial use (including for use in connection with a transportation network company trip or food/package delivery trip);</li>

            <li>(h) to Supply Content that:
              <ul>
                <li>(1)  is unlawful, harmful, hateful, threatening, abusive, violent, profane, discriminatory, prejudicial, disparaging, fraudulent, inaccurate, misleading, dangerous, sexual in nature, offensive, indecent, harassing, threatening, intimidating, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another’s privacy, or otherwise objectionable; </li>
                <li>(2) infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights (“<strong>Rights</strong>”) of any party; </li>
                <li>(3) includes or constitutes unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional material, “junk mail,” “spam,” “chain letters,” “pyramid schemes,” “spimming,” “phishing,” “trolling,” or similar activities, or</li>
                <li>(4) contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment including, but not limited, to any viruses, spiders, data mines, time bombs, Trojan horses, cancelbots, or worms.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><u>7.2  Wyth’s Right to Investigate and Remove Prohibited Content. </u></strong> Although Wyth does not approve and/or pre-screen Content, Wyth (and its employees and representatives) has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to investigate, refuse, move, or remove any Content Supplied by you for any reason Wyth (as determined in its sole discretion) deems reasonable. This Section 7.2 will survive termination of this Agreement.</li>
        <li><strong><u>7.3  Items the Services Do NOT Include. </u></strong> The Services are designed to assist Driver Members and Rider Members with offering and locating carpooling opportunities. Among other items, the Services do NOT include:
          <ul>
            <li>(a) Providing legal advice of any kind (including advice regarding insurance requirements or taxes);</li>
            <li>(b) Intervening in, or resolving, disputes between Users;</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><u>8. Fees, Charges and Payments.</u></strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><u>8.1  Fee for Use of Services. </u></strong> Contemporaneously with your receipt of a notice of a Confirmed Trip, you will pay a transaction fee to Wyth plus any applicable sales and use taxes. At the conclusion of a Confirmed Trip (at the time the Eligible Vehicle for such Trip arrives at the Destination for such Trip), you will pay to Wyth the Trip Cost plus any applicable sales or use taxes related to the Trip Cost.
          <ul>
            <li><strong><u>(a)  Trip Cost Definition. </u></strong> The “<strong>Trip Cost</strong>” for a Confirmed Trip is the amount that was mutually agreed upon by you and the Driver Member. </li>
            <li><strong><u>(b)  No Guarantee of Trip Cost. </u></strong> Wyth does not monitor and does not prescribe the route taken between the Origin and the Destination of a Confirmed Trip. There is no guarantee that a Driver Member will take the shortest or most efficient route between the Origin and the Destination. The length in time and mileage of a Confirmed Trip may vary or be impacted by factors beyond a Driver Member’s control including traffic, detours, road conditions, and GPS or map inaccuracies.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><u>8.2  Method of Payment. </u></strong> Subject to applicable Law, by entering into this Agreement you authorize Wyth to charge all amounts due under this Agreement to the credit card or debit card in your name you provided to Wyth (the “<strong>Payment Method</strong>”).

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><u>9. Financial Responsibility for Loss; Reporting Incidents; Cooperation.</u></strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><u>9.1  Financial Responsibility. </u></strong> To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you are responsible for all damages, losses, costs or expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by you or caused by you in connection with the Services.</li>
        <li><strong><u>9.2  Reporting of Accidents. </u></strong> Promptly on the occurrence of any incident involving vehicle damage, theft, or bodily injury (including a motor vehicle accident) in connection with a Carpool Trip, you will report such incident to Wyth and to the local law enforcement agency as applicable. Within 3 days of such incident (or earlier, if required by Law), you will file with such local law enforcement agency a written report of such incident including a written description of the incident and the insurance information of the other parties involved, if applicable.

You will not assume any obligation, make or commit to make any payment or incur any expense on Wyth’s behalf without Wyth’s prior written consent. </li>
        <li><strong><u>9.4  Survival. </u></strong> This Section 9 will survive termination of this Agreement.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong><u>14.  Dispute Resolution. </u></strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><u>14.1 Arbitration. </u></strong> To the extent feasible, the Parties desire to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of, in connection with, or relating to your use of or access of the Services, this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of this Agreement, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (a “<strong>Dispute</strong>”) through discussions and negotiations between each other. The Parties agree to attempt to resolve any Disputes by negotiation with the other Party (by phone, electronic correspondence, or written correspondence). If, after good faith discussions, a Dispute(s) cannot be resolved solely between the Parties, such Dispute(s) will be determined by arbitration in the State of Illinois before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) in accordance with AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This provision will not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. This Section 14 will survive termination of this Agreement.</li>
        <li><strong><u>14.2 Conduct of Arbitration. </u></strong> The arbitration will be commenced by the claimant party filing a demand for arbitration with the administrator of AAA and serving the demand on the opposing party. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the demand for arbitration is filed, the Parties will select an arbitrator by following the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules’ appointment procedures. The arbitrator’s award will be in writing accompanied by a reasoned opinion and a written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</li>
        <li><strong><u>14.3 Costs. </u></strong> The arbitrator will determine how the costs and expenses of the arbitration will be allocated between the Parties, and may award attorneys’ fees. </li>
        <li><strong><u>14.4 Limitation of Liability. </u></strong> In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator shall have the power to award any party any remedies that would be available to that party in his or her individual capacity in a court of law for the claims presented to and decided by the arbitrator.</li>
        <li><strong><u>14.5 Arbitration is on an Individual Basis Only; Class Action Waiver. </u></strong> THE PARTIES AGREE TO ARBITRATE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT PERMIT CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ARBITRATOR’S POWER TO RULE ON HIS OR HER OWN JURISDICTION AND THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, THE ARBITRATOR HAS NO POWER TO RULE ON THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN THE EVENT THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATION IS DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS SECTION 14 WILL REMAIN IN FORCE.</li>
        <li><strong><u>14.6 Applicable Law. </u></strong> This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules.

Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).  </li>
