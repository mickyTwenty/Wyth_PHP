In order to do so, you will use the Platform to Supply certain information about the type of Carpool Trip on which you are offering Available Seats for Rider Members to bid on including the Origin, Destination, number of Available Seats, and Departure Time with respect to such Carpool Trip. After you Supply such information, the Platform will take such information and “match” such Carpool Trip with Rider Members who may be interested in the opportunity to bid on an Available Seat for such Carpool Trip (each, a “<strong>Potential Rider</strong>,” and collectively, the “Potential Riders”). In order to Supply information about a Carpool Trip on the Platform, such Carpool Trip must have at least one Available Seat.</li>
            <li><strong><u>4.3  Matching Results.</u></strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><u>(a)  Your Receipt of Content Supplied by Potential Riders.</u></strong> . If Wyth identifies a Potential Rider for a Carpool Trip for which you have offered Available Seats, Wyth will provide you with certain Content Supplied by the Potential Rider. This Content will include the Potential Rider’s Profile, which among other things, contains information such as the Rider’s name, profile picture, cumulative star rating and number of cancelled trips.</li>
                    <li><strong><u>(b) Sharing of Content from Your Profile.</u></strong> You understand that not only will you potentially receive Content Supplied by Potential Riders (including some of their profile Content), but that Content you Supply to Wyth (including some of the Content you Supply for your Profile) may also be made available to Rider Members looking for Available Seats on which they would like to bid. Additionally, you may be contacted directly by Rider Members via the messaging and chat features in the App. With respect to Content you Supply to Wyth, you grant Wyth, its affiliates, licensees, successors, and representatives an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, worldwide right and license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such Content and the irrevocable right to sublicense the Content with the sublicensee having the right to transfer or sublicense the Content with the transferor or sublicensee, respectively, having the right to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, publicly display, and prepare derivative works of, such Content (in whole or in part and including any such derivative works) and to incorporate such Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed. This Section 4.3(b) will survive termination of this Agreement.</li>
                    <li><strong><u>(c) No Obligation or Guarantee Regarding Number of Potential Riders. </u></strong> While it is Wyth’s desire that you find Potential Riders to fill all of the Available Seats on a Carpool Trip you are offering, Wyth does not guarantee that you will find any Potential Riders through your use of the Services, and Wyth does not guarantee that it will present you with any, or any specific number of, Potential Riders. Wyth also disclaims any obligation to continually or periodically update or rematch the Content you Supply in connection with searching for Potential Riders with any newly-available Potential Riders.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><u>5. Accepting a Bid.</u></strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><u>5.1  Notification of a Bid on an Available Seat. </u></strong> If you have offered Available Seats on a Carpool Trip via the Platform, you will receive notification from the Platform if a Rider Member offers a Bid for an Available Seat for such Carpool Trip. A “<strong>Bid</strong>” is the amount of reimbursement per mile a Rider Member is offering in exchange for an Available Seat on a Carpool Trip. You are not required to accept a Bid in relation to a Carpool Trip. If you consider a Bid to be too low, you can make a counter-offer. BY ACCEPTING A BID, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WYTH DOES NOT CONDUCT BACKGROUND CHECKS, CREDIT CHECKS OR SIMILAR “SCREENING” ON RIDER MEMBERS OR DRIVER MEMBERS, AND THAT WYTH DOES NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO FACT-CHECK RIDER MEMBER OR DRIVER MEMBER CONTENT, SUCH AS RIDER MEMBER OR DRIVER MEMBER PROFILES, OR VERIFY THAT THE PICTURE UPLOADED TO THE RIDER MEMBER OR DRIVER MEMBER PROFILE MATCHES THE DRIVER MEMBER OR RIDER MEMBER. IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE AND SAFE TAKING A CARPOOL TRIP, AND YOUR SAFETY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND ANY CARPOOL TRIP IS SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.</li>
            <li><strong><u>5.2  Notification of Accepted Bid. </u></strong> If you accept a Bid for an Available Seat on a Carpool Trip, the Platform will notify the Rider Member who offered such Bid that the Bid has been accepted, and such Carpool Trip will be considered a “<strong>Confirmed Trip.</strong>” The Bid you accepted for such Available Seat for such Carpool Trip will be referred to as a “<strong>Confirmed Bid.</strong>” For the avoidance of doubt, a “<strong>Confirmed Trip</strong>” is a Carpool Trip that has at least one confirmed Rider Member passenger (due to such Rider Member having a Confirmed Bid) and that is scheduled to operate. </li>
            <li><strong><u>5.3  Significance of a Confirmed Trip. </u></strong> If a Carpool Trip you have offered via the Platform becomes a Confirmed Trip, such Carpool Trip is scheduled to operate and at least one Rider Member is relying on such Carpool Trip operating as scheduled.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><u>6. Confirmed Trips. </u></strong>
        <ul>

                            <li>(2) in violation of, or to violate, any law, regulation, ordinance, rule, or similar authority (each, a “Law”); </li>
                            <li>(3) unsafely or unreasonably;</li>
                            <li>(4) in a way that purposely or unreasonably deviates from an efficient route between the Origin and the Destination for such Carpool Trip;</li>
                            <li>(5) if you are under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication which may affect your ability to drive;</li>

                            <li>(8) loaded beyond the manufacturer’s stated passenger capacity for such vehicle;</li>
                            <li>(9) for carrying passengers other than in the interior of the vehicle; </li>
                            <li>(10)    for carrying more passengers than there are seatbelts in the vehicle; </li>
                            <li>(11)    while operating devices that require one or both hands while driving, including, but not limited to, cell phones, mobile computers or devices that allow texting or without following any applicable local laws and regulations relating to mobile phone use; </li>
                            <li>(12)    while wearing any device that limits your ability to hear, see, or otherwise judge driving conditions; and</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong><u>6.3  During the Course of a Confirmed Trip. </u></strong> Wyth does not monitor or oversee Confirmed Trips. It is up to you to make sure that if at any time you feel unsafe on a Confirmed Trip, including if you observe a Rider Member violating the Law, that you contact the proper authorities to help.</li>
            <li><strong><u>6.4  Cancellation. </u></strong> You can cancel a Confirmed Trip at any time prior to picking up the Rider. However, your Driver Profile will reflect the number of trips cancelled and your ratings may suffer as a result of cancellations. If you cancel the Confirmed Trip, the Rider Member will be notified via email or SMS. Similarly, if the Rider Member cancels the trip, you will be notified via email or SMS, and the Rider Member will have an opportunity to bid on Available Seats again. </li>
            <li><strong><u>6.5  Reporting Violations of the “Wyth Membership Agreement -- Rider Member.”</u></strong> If you observe a Rider Member violating the “Wyth Membership Agreement -- Rider Member” [Link] (the “<strong>Rider Membership Agreement</strong>”), and if you feel it is safe to do so, you should ask such Rider Member to cease such violation, and you should promptly report such violation to local authorities (if appropriate), and to Wyth, so Wyth can investigate such violation if (in Wyth’s sole discretion) it is appropriate to do so.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><u>7. Prohibited Uses of the Services; Wyth’s Right to Investigate and Remove Prohibited Content; Items the Services Do Not Provide. </u></strong>

        <ul>
            <li><strong><u>14.1 Arbitration. </u></strong> To the extent feasible, the Parties desire to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of, in connection with, or relating to your use of or access of the Services, this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of this Agreement, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (a “<strong>Dispute</strong>”) through discussions and negotiations between each other. The Parties agree to attempt to resolve any Disputes by negotiation with the other Party (by phone, electronic correspondence, or written correspondence). If, after good faith discussions, a Dispute(s) cannot be resolved solely between the Parties, such Dispute(s) will be determined by arbitration in the State of Illinois before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) in accordance with AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This provision will not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. This Section 14 will survive termination of this Agreement.</li>
            <li><strong><u>14.2 Conduct of Arbitration. </u></strong> The arbitration will be commenced by the claimant party filing a demand for arbitration with the administrator of AAA and serving the demand on the opposing party. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the demand for arbitration is filed, the Parties will select an arbitrator by following the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules’ appointment procedures. The arbitrator’s award will be in writing accompanied by a reasoned opinion and a written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</li>

            <li><strong><u>14.5 Arbitration is on an Individual Basis Only; Class Action Waiver. </u></strong> THE PARTIES AGREE TO ARBITRATE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT PERMIT CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ARBITRATOR’S POWER TO RULE ON HIS OR HER OWN JURISDICTION AND THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, THE ARBITRATOR HAS NO POWER TO RULE ON THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN THE EVENT THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATION IS DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS SECTION 14 WILL REMAIN IN FORCE.</li>
